# NeoQuanta AI Model

## Overview
NeoQuanta is a self-generating, locally run AI system capable of recursively improving its architecture and writing its own code without example-driven programming. It efficiently utilizes local hardware resources and incorporates a modular, extensible architecture for ease of iteration and scalability.

## Features
- Efficiently utilizes CPU, GPU, Coral TPU, Raspberry Pi clusters, and other connected devices.
- Implements a self-scanning system that identifies and configures all available hardware for optimal use.
- Incorporates a modular, extensible architecture for ease of iteration and scalability.
- Includes robust error handling and self-diagnostics.

## Setup Instructions
